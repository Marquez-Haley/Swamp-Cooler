# CPE301 Swamp Cooler Project
Team members: Haley Marquez, Alicia Chiang, Tayshawn Williams
The goal of this project was to create a swamp cooler using the Arduino Mega 2560 R3. The swamp cooler is meant to have 4 modes, running, off, idle, and error. These modes are based off of checking humidity, temperature, water levels, and an off button. 

Design Requirement of Swamp Cooler

• Water level monitoring

• Vent direction control with stepper motor

• LCD display

• Real-time clock module

• Temp/humidity sensor DHT11

• Fan motor
